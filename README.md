## Overview

This project provides a graphical representation of pathfinding algorithms. It uses a grid system where you can set start and target positions, add walls, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path.

## Features 

**Interactive Grid**: Easily draw walls, set the starting point, and define the target destination using mouse interactions.
**Pathfinding Algorithms**: Currently, the program supports a basic pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the target.

## Usage

- **Left Mouse Button**: Draw walls on the grid.
- **Right Mouse Button**: Set the target position.
- **Keyboard**: Press any key to start the pathfinding algorithm after setting the target.
